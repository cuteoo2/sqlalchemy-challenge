The Climate Data was analyzed and explored using 

- SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the SQLite database

- SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect the tables into classes

- And linked Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session

- Precipitation and Station analysis done by querying the data

- Climate App was designed by designing a Flash API based on the queries created for the analysis.
